INSTALLING cl-launch
====================

If you're going to build things that depend on cl-launch using ASDF or XCVB,
you need to install cl-launch.

However, even without installation, cl-launch will work happily as a
standalone script that drives the building of simple executables or
ones that use ASDF.


Simple installation
-------------------

If you want to install cl-launch at its default location in ``/usr/local``,
just you::

	sudo make install

If instead you want it in ``/usr``, do::

	sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

A list of variables you may want to modify or override is
at the beginning of the ``Makefile``.


Advanced installation
---------------------

You can decide separately where the binary will be using ``INSTALL_BIN``
(to override the default of ``$PREFIX/bin``)
and where the Lisp source code will go using ``INSTALL_SOURCE``
(to override the default of ``$PREFIX/share/common-lisp/source/cl-launch``)
with a symlink to the asd file going in ``INSTALL_SYSTEMS``
(to override the default of ``$PREFIX/share/common-lisp/systems``).


Update and reinstallation
-------------------------

Personally, I have a ``./reinstall`` script that does::

	make install_system PREFIX=$HOME/.local

and if not for a judicious symlink
from ``$HOME/bin/cl-launch`` to my checkout,
it would also do::

	make install_binary PREFIX=$HOME


Configuration
-------------

Of course you should adjust your ``PATH``,
your ``asdf:*central-registry*`` and your ``XCVB_PATH``
coherently with where you install cl-launch.


Faking the installation
-----------------------

If you just want to see what cl-launch will create
without installing it to the final destination,
you can install to a fake destination::

	mkdir -p build/bin build/systems build/source
	make install INSTALL_BIN=${PWD}/build/bin INSTALL_SOURCE=${PWD}/build/source INSTALL_SYSTEMS=${PWD}/build/systems
