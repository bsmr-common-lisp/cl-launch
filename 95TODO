TODO for cl-launch as of 2.31

 * Fix the support for ECL when built from image
   To test it, try (in a new scratch directory):
        cl-launch -l ecl -B tests
        cl-launch -l ecl -B tests 174 # --image breaks ecl 9.6.1
        cl-launch -l ecl -B tests 73 # --dump breaks ecl 9.10.2

 * Add an option to wrap an existing image that already has cl-launch
   loaded in it, and/or detect that the image does,
   and skip the loading of cl-launch,
   thereby save the time and disk space of image dumping.
