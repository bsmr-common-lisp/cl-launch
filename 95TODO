TODO for cl-launch as of 2.31

 * Fix the support for ECL standalone executables.

 * Add an option to wrap an existing image that already has cl-launch
   loaded in it, and/or detect that the image does,
   and skip the loading of cl-launch,
   thereby save the time and disk space of image dumping.
