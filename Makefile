# You may want to e.g.
#   sudo make install PREFIX=/usr
# Personally, I have a ./reinstall script that does
#   make install_system PREFIX=$HOME/.local
# and if not for a judicious symlink from $HOME/bin/cl-launch to my checkout,
# it would also do
#   make install_binary PREFIX=$HOME
# Of course you should adjust your PATH and your asdf:*central-registry*
# coherently with where you install cl-launch.
#
# If you just want to see what cl-launch will create without installing it to the final destination,
# you can:
#   mkdir -p build/bin build/systems build/source ;
#   make install INSTALL_BIN=${PWD}/build/bin INSTALL_SOURCE=${PWD}/build/source INSTALL_SYSTEMS=${PWD}/build/systems
