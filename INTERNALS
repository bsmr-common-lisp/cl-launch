NOTE TO HACKERS WHO'D LIKE TO HACK cl-launch INTERNALS

I conceive cl-launch as the ultimate exercise in "useful quining".
It's a shell script, it's a Lisp program header and library,
it outputs shell scripts and Lisp programs that may include parts of cl-launch.

cl-launch is very hard to hack. A change you'd think is innocuous will actually
break some complex combination of options on some Lisp implementation and shell
variant. Even for the simplest of changes, I recommend running a full test before
you release, which may involve:

	LISPS="clisp sbcl ccl ecl gclcvs cmucl gcl" # include whatever you have
	mkdir -p ${TMP:-/tmp}/cl-launch-test &&
        cd ${TMP:-/tmp}/cl-launch-test &&
        ${CL-LAUNCH} -l "${LISPS}" -B tests &&
        ${CL-LAUNCH} -l clisp -B shell_tests

If you add a new option, you probably should be adding a test for in somewhere in
the shell function do_tests, which will double the testing time, currently over an
hour for me.

Happy hacking!
