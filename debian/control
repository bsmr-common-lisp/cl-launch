Description: uniform frontend to running Common Lisp code from the shell
 CL-Launch will allow you to invoke Common Lisp source code from the shell
 command line or from a shell script. It will also allow you to turn your
 Common Lisp source programs into standalone executables or executable shell
 scripts (optionally using a dumped image), depending on the features
 available in your underlying implementation.
 .
 CL-Launch will automatically detect a supported Common Lisp implementation
 and use adequate invocation options. It can also be configured to fit exactly
 the programmer's desires. Supported implementations are:
     SBCL, CMUCL, GNU CLISP, ECL, OpenMCL, Allegro, GCL, LispWorks Pro.
 (GCL 2.6 support has limitations; GCL 2.7 has been broken for me on debian.)
 .
 CL-Launch also offers Common Lisp programs a simple uniform interface to
 invocation parameters (command-line arguments and environment variables).
 It relies on ASDF 2 for system construction. See the ASDF 2 manual for
 more information on how to configure source and object code location.
 CL-Launch may save memory images for fast startup (at the expense of disk
 space). It can also be used as a quick way to evaluate and print simple Lisp
 forms or scripts from the command-line without invoking a full-fledged REPL.
