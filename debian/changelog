cl-launch (2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * add basic clbuild support. Not included in test suite (yet).
  * better support :package argument to dump-image.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 2008 21:23:42 -0500

cl-launch (2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for standalone executables on CLISP 2.48.
  * Debugged image dumping with ECL support some more.
    The second strategy (creating temporary .asd's) works better.
    However, ASDF seems confused if you don't rm -rf your object cache in
    ~/.cache/lisp-fasl/ecl*.
  * Better document the standalone executable support.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Sun, 09 Nov 2008 23:40:36 -0500

cl-launch (2.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * added a new magic environment variable CL_LAUNCH_DEBUG that enables

   whereby we can now dump standalone executables.
  * Rename DIRECT_EXECUTABLE to STANDALONE_EXECUTABLE.
  * Refactor command-line argument detection for standalone executables.
  * Actually implement support for LispWorks - for Professional edition only.
  * Fix bug reported by Koga Kazuo, whereby on Mac OS X (and presumably
   other systems), /bin/sh doesn't support option -n to echo.
   Using the POSIX-mandated printf instead (via function ECHOn).
  * Rename OpenMCL to CCL (ClozureCL), drop support for older (pre)releases.
  * Remove builder patch for ecl 0.9i

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Wed, 29 Oct 2008 09:09:04 -0400

cl-launch (2.07-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * commented out (sb-pcl::precompile-random-code-segments) in save-image
    as it may cause some systems to grind to a halt. Users can still do it
    themselves if they want it, it is purely a performance issue.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Thu, 17 May 2007 18:22:23 -0400

cl-launch (2.06-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve packaging: suggest rather than depend on c-l-c
   (for the sake of non-Debian users).
  * (non-Debian change) make an asdf-installable package for cl-launch.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Tue, 24 Apr 2007 18:54:48 -0400

cl-launch (2.06-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * extend the API function QUIT with a new optional argument
   FINISH-OUTPUT (default T). When this argument is T, QUIT will
   FINISH-OUTPUT on *STANDARD-OUTPUT* and *ERROR-OUTPUT*.
   This replaces the (removed) internal function %QUIT.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Tue, 10 Apr 2007 17:39:33 -0400

cl-launch (2.05-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix GCL 2.6 and 2.7, that were broken by the fix in cl-launch 2.04:
   the former doesn't have ENSURE-DIRECTORY-EXISTS occurrences of which
   were featured out, and the latter has issues with *LOAD-PATHNAME*
   incorrectly containing type lisp when it should have no type, which
   means that :pathname had to be specified in defsystem :cl-launch least
   it fail when the file has no extension. Also that system::*tmp-dir*
   ends with a /
  * Some minor documentation updates
  * SBCL: enable tail-call optimization; precompile CLOSy things before dump.
  * made cl-launch to be fully functional if it is the first system
   dependency in your asdf:defsystem (you still need a system-provided
   asdf for this to work fully).
  * OpenMCL: better distinguish FASL versions
  * completely tested with
       gcl gclcvs sbcl cmucl clisp ecl openmcl allegro

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Tue, 20 Mar 2007 17:25:11 -0400

cl-launch (2.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * make cl-launch more robust wrt missing directories
   (can't truename or resolve-symlinks then)
  * mark the ecl patch as not needed for latest CVS (but still for 0.9i)
  * rename *fasl-cache* to *lisp-fasl-cache*

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Fri, 12 Jan 2007 00:25:08 -0500

cl-launch (2.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix two bugs found by mkennedy at gentoo:
   use of truename on the cache path before it may exist
   call to a deleted shell function in the help.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Tue, 21 Nov 2006 00:08:43 -0500

cl-launch (2.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * completely tested with
         clisp ecl gcl gclcvs sbcl cmucl openmcl allegro
   some with and some without clc
  * wholly untested lispworks support
  * clarification of the situation of clisp and sbcl wrt DIRECT_EXECUTABLE
   (i.e. not yet).
  * self-test framework: account for shell variety, better criterion for cleanup
  * fix issues wrt pathnames, in resolve-symlinks & lisp-cache env var & gcl2.6
  * superficial fixes

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Mon, 16 Oct 2006 05:54:47 -0400

cl-launch (2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release 2.0 passes full regression tests on all of
       clisp ecl gcl gclcvs
    and should work but hasn't been extensively tested with
       sbcl cmucl openmcl allegro
  * New "direct executable" feature supported on clisp and ecl: do away with
   the intermediate of a wrapper script and directly produce an executable.
  * We now fully support ECL. Success with dumping image from a system at last!
   Moreover, we dump a standalone :program, not a :fasl anymore; plus we take
   precautions to extract correct init-function-name from a library path.
   Search cl-launch code for "ECL PATCH" for modifications to ecl 0.9i sources.
  * After testing with not just bash and zsh, but also dash and posh,
   restore compatibility with posh that doesn't know -a and -o in [ ... ]
  * update documentation wrt GCL and ECL support, side-effects, etc.

cl-launch (1.93-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This "full GCL support" release passes full regression tests on all of
       clisp sbcl cmucl ecl gclcvs gcl allegro openmcl
  * GCL: fix issue with compiling scripts without pathname type,
   and add support for image dump -- many thanks to Camm Maguire.
  * ECL: fix pathname type issue with build-fasl; desperate (and unsuccessful)
   attempt to modify builder so as to create a .fas from a system.
  * General issue with dumping: recompute the dynamic environment at each
   execution, not just when initially dumping. (I detected this because GCL
   had a similar bug with its *tmp-dir*, which we now work around.)
  * Disable the common-lisp-controller cache for GCL, since clc 6 is broken.
  * Fix bitrot in support for running without clc.
  * Fixed hairy bugs I could hardly fathom due to the interaction between
   the many many modes and evaluation times of cl-launch.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Fri, 13 Oct 2006 23:24:26 -0400

cl-launch (1.92-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This "quick fix" release passes full regression tests on all of
       clisp sbcl cmucl ecl gclcvs gcl allegro openmcl
  * brown bag error for using find-system without nil-errors, that would
   break all non-clc installed implementations that have no cl-launch system.
  * until openmcl is fixed wrt -I handling, fall back to using exec_lisp_noarg

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Wed, 11 Oct 2006 23:38:52 +0200

cl-launch (1.91-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This "corner rounding" release passes full regression tests on all of
       clisp sbcl cmucl ecl gclcvs gcl allegro openmcl
  * make gcl load scripts it can't compile because their pathname lacks a type
  * make clisp properly compile scripts without a pathname type.
  * work around is a bug in clisp 2.40 option parsing (fixed in 2.41), by
   introducing a pseudo-filename after -- and skipping it in ext:*args*
  * use defsystem inside cl-launch, so that there will be no attempt to later
   miscompile an installed header into something empty due to #-cl-launch,
   which would confuse other software that depends on cl-launch but is being
   loaded without cl-launch (e.g. from SLIME).
  * fix --include /... for all shells by reshuffling BASIC_ENV_CODE
  * fix and/or work around some race condition in cacheing causing transient
   errors in the regression test suite, due to compilation happening within
   the same split second as automatic generation of next source code, which
   confuses clisp. I'm unable to fathom whether the race is due to a bug in
   cl-launch, clisp or the linux kernel, and so I won't blame others.
  * make sure ABORT is defined in the wrapper
  * regression test report

cl-launch (1.87-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * due to popular request, add a resource file feature, a --rc/--no-rc
   option pair to enable/disable this feature, and the ability to configure
   cl-launch into having it enabled or disabled by default. Closes: #384697.

 -- Francois-Rene Rideau <fare@tunes.org>  Wed, 30 Aug 2006 02:51:16 +0200

cl-launch (1.86-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * include image dumping in automated test suite, catching several bugs.
  * fix a nasty bug stupidly introduced in 1.83 whereby command-line arguments
   were not recomputed anymore when restarting from a dumped image (doh).
  * got --dump to work well with --update
  * try to get ECL to compile systems further, but hit some c::builder issues.
    See my messages of this month (august 2006) on the ECL mailing list.
  * tried to debug support for gcl 2.6.7-17:
   got --file working again (w/o fasl cache), but --system is hopeless.
  * gclcvs 2.7.0-54 doesn't even install properly anymore; on a system where
   it is installed of old its EVAL-WHEN seems badly broken.

  * fix compile-file-pathname* (and thus option -f) in presence of c-l-c
  * add apply-output-pathname-translations to the API
  * refactor the image-dumping infrastructure to allow support for ECL;
    kluges to get around ECL 0.9i bug in c::builder pathname type handling.
    Many thanks to people on the ecls-list for help.
  NB: as of debian package ecl-0.9i-2, you must
        export ECL=/usr/lib/ecl/ecl-original
  for cl-launch to work with ECL, due to bug in debian packaging of ECL.
